Z2 is statically-typed pure-OOP general-use performance-centric systems-programming language. It has the following key features:
<ul>
<li>it is a statically typed language that compiles to dependency less native platform binaries</li>
<li>it is closely related to C++, but also draws inspiration from C#, Delphi and Ruby</li>
<li>it tries to solve the same problems as C++ using similar constructs, but is a smaller easier to learn more sanitized language</li>
<li>it systematically tries to address all the issues of C++, while still maintaining a comparable feature set</li>
<li>it is a practical language, with each feature being a consequence of some programming problem and solution that was encountered in the past</li>
<li>it is performance centric and has the goal to be just as fast and in some cases even faster than C++, while addressing most of the safety concerns of it</li>
<li>it is a system programing language, allowing you to get close to the metal, do system calls and has no mandatory overhead to its features</li>
<li>the compiler also the main build tool and arbitrarily large projects can be compiled with a single call to the compiler</li>
<li>the compiler has a single front-end that compiles source code into an intermediate form and an open set of backend compilers that take that intermediate form and generate native platform binaries</li>
<li>it uses a modern module system for building, where projects are divided into multiple packages with dependency management, each package is compiled only once and is designed to minimize backend compilations (these are slow) at the expense of more frontend compilations (these are fast)
